# SEGR:Semantic Enhancement and Graph Reasoning for Scene Text Recognition
The SEGR scene text recognition algorithm proposed in this paper mining semantic information through semantic enhancement module for text recognition based on semantic enhancement, and then correcting the misrecognized text characters according to context information through graph reasoning mechanism, which improves the text recognition accuracy.
